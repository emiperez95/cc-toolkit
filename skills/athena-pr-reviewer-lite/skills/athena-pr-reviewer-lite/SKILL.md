# Athena PR Reviewer (Lite)

Claude-only version with 6 specialized reviewers. No Gemini or Codex required.

## Instructions

### 1. Detect PR Target

Parse user input to identify the PR:

- **Direct PR reference** (`PR 123`, `#123`): Extract number directly
- **Jira ticket** (`PROJ-123`): Run `gh pr list --search "PROJ-123" --json number --jq '.[0].number'`
- **Current branch**: Run `gh pr view --json number --jq '.number'`
- **No PR found**: Extract Jira from branch with `git branch --show-current | grep -oE '[A-Z]+-[0-9]+'`

### 2. Gather Data (Script)

Run the gather-context script which collects all data in parallel:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer-lite/scripts/gather-context.sh ${PR_NUM} ${JIRA_TICKET}
```

This script:
- Creates work directory at `/tmp/athena-review-${PR_NUM}/`
- Fetches in parallel: PR metadata, diff, Jira ticket, epic, CLAUDE.md guidelines, git blame, prior PR comments
- Writes combined context to `${WORK_DIR}/context.md`
- Writes diff to `${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch`

Output files:
- `context.md` - Combined PR + Jira + guidelines + history data
- `diff.patch` - Full PR diff
- `pr.json` - Raw PR metadata
- `jira.json` - Raw Jira ticket data
- `epic.json` - Epic context (if linked)
- `guidelines.md` - All CLAUDE.md files from repo
- `blame.md` - Git blame for changed files (who wrote what, when)
- `prior-comments.md` - Comments from past PRs touching same files

### 3. Run Reviews (6 Claude Specialists in Parallel)

Execute all 6 Claude specialist reviews simultaneously in a SINGLE message with 6 Task tool calls:

Each agent reads its prompt file, then analyzes `${WORK_DIR}/context.md` and `${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch`.

```
Task: general-purpose
Prompt: "Read ~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer-lite/prompts/comment-analyzer.md for instructions.
Then read ${WORK_DIR}/context.md and ${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch. Perform the review. Output markdown."
Save to: ${WORK_DIR}/reviews/claude-comments.md

Task: general-purpose
Prompt: "Read ~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer-lite/prompts/test-analyzer.md for instructions.
Then read ${WORK_DIR}/context.md and ${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch. Perform the review. Output markdown."
Save to: ${WORK_DIR}/reviews/claude-tests.md

Task: general-purpose
Prompt: "Read ~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer-lite/prompts/error-hunter.md for instructions.
Then read ${WORK_DIR}/context.md and ${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch. Perform the review. Output markdown."
Save to: ${WORK_DIR}/reviews/claude-errors.md

Task: general-purpose
Prompt: "Read ~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer-lite/prompts/type-reviewer.md for instructions.
Then read ${WORK_DIR}/context.md and ${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch. Perform the review. Output markdown."
Save to: ${WORK_DIR}/reviews/claude-types.md

Task: general-purpose
Prompt: "Read ~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer-lite/prompts/code-reviewer.md for instructions.
Then read ${WORK_DIR}/context.md and ${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch. Perform the review. Output markdown."
Save to: ${WORK_DIR}/reviews/claude-general.md

Task: general-purpose
Prompt: "Read ~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer-lite/prompts/simplifier.md for instructions.
Then read ${WORK_DIR}/context.md and ${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch. Perform the review. Output markdown."
Save to: ${WORK_DIR}/reviews/claude-simplify.md
```

### 4. Aggregate Reviews

Read all 6 review files and combine findings:

**Reviewers:**
- Claude: comments, tests, errors, types, general, simplify

**Confidence Filtering:**
- Drop findings with confidence < 80
- Keep findings 50-79 only if flagged by 2+ reviewers

**Priority Boost Rule:** Items flagged by 2+ reviewers get bumped up one severity level.

| Reviewers | Original | Final Severity |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 3+        | High     | Critical       |
| 2         | High     | Critical       |
| 3+        | Medium   | High           |
| 2         | Medium   | High           |
| 1         | Any      | No boost       |

Deduplicate similar findings, noting which reviewer(s) flagged each and average confidence.

### 4.5 Verify Findings

For each aggregated finding, verify against actual code to filter hallucinations:

1. Read `${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch` to get the actual code
2. For each finding with file:line reference:
   - Extract the actual code at that location from the diff
   - Compare the finding's description to what the code actually does
3. Use the verifier prompt (`~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer-lite/prompts/verifier.md`) to validate each finding
4. Filter based on verdict:
   - **✓ VERIFIED** → Keep in final output
   - **✗ REJECTED** → Write to `${WORK_DIR}/rejected.md` with reason
   - **⚠️ PARTIAL** → Keep but move to "Suggestions" section

Output verified findings to `${WORK_DIR}/verified-findings.md`

### 5. Synthesize Actionable Items

Present combined review to user:

```markdown
# PR Review: {PR_TITLE} (#{PR_NUM})

## Requirements Status
| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|

## Action Items (Verified)

### Critical (consensus, verified)
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [Claude-errors + Claude-tests + Claude-types] (3+, avg 92%) ✓

### High Priority (verified)
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [Claude-errors + Claude-tests] <- boosted (2, avg 85%) ✓
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [Claude-types] (95%) ✓

### Medium Priority (verified)

### Suggestions

## Rejected Findings
Findings that failed verification are saved to: `${WORK_DIR}/rejected.md`
